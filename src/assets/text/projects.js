          The world has been chopping down 10 million hectares of trees every
          year to make space to grow crops and livestock, and to produce
          materials such as paper. This accounts for about 16% of total tree
          loss cover. 96% of deforestation takes place in tropical forests.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most stunning deforestation facts is that forest loss
          contributes nearly 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the
          atmosphere every year, which is equivalent to nearly 10% of annual
          human emissions. NASA researchers found that accelerated slashing and
          burning methods of land clearing in Borneo, the third-largest island
          in the world and home to one of the oldest rainforests in the world,
          contributed to the largest single-year global increase in carbon
          emissions in two millenniums, driving Indonesia up towards a leading
          source of carbon emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.75 million hectares of tropical primary rainforests were lost in
          2021 alone. This resulted in 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide
          emissions, equivalent to the annual fossil fuel emissions of India and
          nearly 10 soccer pitches a minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          One-third of tropical deforestation happens in Brazil alone. That
          amounts to approximately 1.7 million hectares each year. Both Brazil
          and Indonesia are home to some of the world’s largest and biodiverse
          tropical forests in the world. As the agricultural industry continues
          to practice land clearing for crop and livestock farming, the threat
          to biodiversity only worsens. Studies say observed animal populations
          have experienced an average 68% decline in population numbers. In
          Borneo, Indonesia, the critically endangered orangutan lost nearly 80%
          of its population within the last 50 years.

        Every year, millions of tonnes of plastic enters the ocean. Mostly from
        rivers around the world. One study estimated there were almost 15

        as many as 51 trillion.

        Floating plastic acts as a magnet for pesticides, flame retardants and
        other chemicals found in the ocean. These chemicals are known to disrupt
        human hormones and cause cancer. It can take centuries to break down.
        Many scientists believe plastic never completely disappears -
        particularly if it's submerged in deep or cold water. A drink bottle can
        take 450 years to break down, while a plastic fishing line could last
        for 600 years. If Christopher Columbus had tossed some plastic overboard

        Climate solutions all have their root in two areas: science and story.
        Science gives us the tools and evidence whilst story communicates why
        the problem matters and how solutions can help. Activism and
        storytelling are often not included in lists of climate solutions
        because they often do not directly reduce or remove pollution (I.e CO2
        and plastic) from the environment. However this fails to take into
        account their impact and crucial role in the climate crisis. Drawing
        attention to climate change increases awareness and education of the
        problems, which encourages people, businesses and governments to take
        action supporting and funding the science based solutions we need to
        move forward.
      </div>
      <div style={styles.secondheader}>History of the climate movement</div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        Whilst the roots of the climate movement are hard to pin down,
        especially if you take into account the scientific and cultural history
        surrounding the issue; arguably, modern climate activism begins with the
        first Earth Day in 1970, the creation of the IPCC in 1988 as well as the
        UNFCC and Climate Action Network in 1992. Earth Day was a citizen led
        event inspired by the anti-war movement. The Climate Action Network
        counts Greenpeace, WWF, Oxfam and Friends of the Earth as major members.
        The IPCC and UNFCC both stem from the United Nations. These examples
        represent the top-down versus bottom up approaches within the climate
        movement and lay the foundation for modern developments.
      </div>
      <div style={styles.secondheader}>Bumps in the road</div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        Following the creation of these organisations and the growth of the
        environmental movement there are some bumps in the road. The 1997 Kyoto
        protocol is agreed upon but immediately rejected by the US Senate and in
        2001 the US President George W. Bush removes the US from the Kyoto
        process.
      </div>
      <div style={styles.secondheader}>Resurgence of activism</div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        In 2006, Al Gore releases the award winning film An Inconvenient Truth
        which brings environmental issues back into popular culture and plays a
        key role in inspiring the new generation of activists, leaders and
        policy makers we have today. In more recent years Greta Thunberg has
        played a crucial role in holding governments and corporations to account
        for their often empty promises whilst inspiring individuals to protest
        and make environmental lifestyle changes.

        Nuclear energy plays a significant role in an energy independent future.

        Every year, nuclear-generated electricity saves our atmosphere from 476
        million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise
        likely come from fossil fuels. 476 million metric tons is the equivalent
        of taking more than 103 million passenger vehicles off the road, which
        is almost as many passenger vehicles as are currently on the road in the

        can simply use more renewable energy and slowly reduce our emissions. We

        degrees; or close to it.
      </div>
      <div style={styles.secondheader}>Historic lack of support</div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        Negative emissions have been dramatically underfunded in proportion to
        their importance. This needs to be fixed if we’re going to have a shot
        at reducing the cost enough to make 10-gigaton-scale deployment possible
        by midcentury. It will take likely take years or decades for basic
        research and pilot projects to scale and get cheap enough; so we need to

        We need all solutions, including carbon capture
      </div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        It’s very unlikely any one category of technology, or any one natural
        approach, will scale enough to tackle the majority of emissions
        reduction or carbon capture alone. It is better to think of a portfolio
        across all the solutions available. Most damage from climate is already
        done. Carbon capture is one of very few ways to reverse historic
        pollution by drawing it down from the air.
      </div>
      <div style={styles.secondheader}>How it works and the benefits</div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        The carbon dioxide is safely stored by, for example turning it into
        stone through natural processes. With minimal land and water usage, this
        is one of the most efficient carbon dioxide removal approaches. CO₂ is
        in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world. This means
        that DAC plants can be located anywhere as they do not need to be
        attached to an emissions source. They are only required to be placed
        near a renewable energy source and in a place where CO₂ can be stored.
        Compared to trees DAC plants can be about 1,000 times more efficient.
        That means it does the work of 200,000 trees in 1,000 times less space.

        One of Eden’s monitoring employees was scouting an area to determine if

        from the hyena, then quickly changed his course. As he approached the

        Hailemariam Desalegn of the Southern Nations and Nationalities People’s
        Region asked Steve (Eden’s Founder & CEO) to help run a forest
        restoration project at the Udo Escarpment near Hawassa. After seven
        years, Eden ended their work in Ethiopia with nearly 16 million trees
        produced, planted, and protected by over 3,500 local community members.
        Now, a decade later, Eden are returning to Ethiopia to work with local
        communities in Dawuro to develop a reforestation model that aligns with
        the region’s forest types as well as the communities’ needs.

        Over 70% of Nepal's forests have been destroyed

      <div style={styles.text}>
        Nepal is one of the least developed countries in the world with many
        communities depending on the natural environment for food, shelter, and
        income. Today, less than 30% of its original forests remain due to
        over-harvesting, forest fires, and agriculture. The effects of this
        degradation are devastating for the local communities and wildlife.

        Over half of Eden’s Nepalese workforce are women, and for many, it is
        their first opportunity for consistent employment. Eden’s nursery
        employee, Nima, was struggling to find work after losing her business
        due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Her determination led her to
        connect with the team in Nepal and she is now earning a living wage. All
        of our work in Nepal is led by our fearless National Director, Rachhya,
        who has seen local forests destroyed and is now a big part of the
        restoration efforts. These women are two examples of many who are
        overcoming gender inequality in their nation.

      <div style={styles.text}>
        Deforestation in the last 50 years has caused it to lose 40% of those
        vital forests. Indonesia is one of the most biodiverse regions on the
        planet and home to about 23% of the world’s mangrove forests. However,
        in the last 50 years, Indonesia has lost over 40% of its mangrove
        forests. It is also consistently ranked in the top three countries for
        the highest rate of deforestation. The effects of deforestation have
        significantly impacted indigenous communities, who are often the first
        to feel the negative effects of climate change.

        Sailing between islands and climbing trees. Working in some of
        Indonesia's most remote and least developed areas with limited cell and
        internet service, teams have to make some drastic moves to communicate
        with each other. For example, on Padaidori Island, there are no cell
        towers. As a result, leaders must sail to neighboring islands until they
        have enough cell reception to share planting information and planting
        progress photos. Sometimes, the waves are too treacherous for them to
        sail back to their home, causing our leaders to be stuck on a
        neighboring island for at least a month. In areas with cell towers, the
        cell service is so weak; our Monitor Leader, Bagus Yuhayya Prihmantoro,
        has climbed a tree for a phone call with our US Monitoring Department.
        Sailing to other islands and climbing trees are just two examples of how
        the Indonesian team finds creative solutions to the challenges they face
        in the field.

        99% of Haiti’s primary forests are gone

      <div style={styles.text}>
        Deforestation began in Haiti when colonizers cut down trees for coffee,
        indigo, tobacco, and sugarcane plantations run by slave labor. Today,
        the leading cause of this deforestation is charcoal production and the
        consequences have been devastating. A mere 1% of its primary forests
        remain, and the UN estimates that 30% of those remaining trees are
        destroyed each year.

        In one year, Haiti was hit by a devastating hurricane, a 7.2 magnitude
        earthquake, and faced increasing political instability. These events
        only worsened pre-existing issues the country knows all too well. Yet,
        in the midst of all this, Eden’s team remains steadfastly committed to
        reforesting their land and helping their community by continuing to
        plant thousands of trees to promote food security and poverty
        alleviation.

        Over 250 years ago, the Kalunga people escaped enslavement and settled
        in the Cerrado. There, they lived virtually undetected until researchers
        came in contact with them in the 1960s. Thirty years later, they were
        given the legal right to the land they inhabited. Over the years, parts
        of their land have become degraded and in need of restoration. Eden are
        partnering with the Kalunga people to restore five thousand hectares
        (over nineteen square miles) of their forests.

        Central America has a wide range of ecosystems varying from tropical
        forests, mountains, grasslands, mangroves, and wetlands. These forests
        are home to thousands of indigenous people and endemic species. Despite
        having over nine hundred protected areas, deforestation still threatens
        the lives of those in Central America. For example, the harvesting and
        production of palm oil have led to rapid deforestation in Honduras.

      <div style={styles.secondheader}>Only at Eden Projects</div>
      <div style={styles.text}>
        The key to their success is not only the trees Eden plant but the people
        they employ. Although the work in Central America is new but there have
        already been plenty of challenges for teams to face. With COVID-19 still
        rampant in Central America, teams have worked through lockdowns and
        outbreaks to restore their land. Successfully planting through parching
        droughts due to climate change. Without this determination the work in
        Central America would not be possible.
